## Welcome to My Project!

This proyect "Calculations in Motion" repository. Here, you'll find a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying calculations related to Motion in a Uniformly Accelerated Straight Line (MRUV), with a specific focus on Time of Pursuit and Time of Encounter.

## Features:
The application provides an introduction to Motion in a Uniformly Accelerated Straight Line (MRUV), covering its fundamental equations and essential concepts. It then explores the Pursuit Time, which describes the duration required for a pursuing object to catch up to a target object, and the Encounter Time, which determines when two objects moving towards each other meet.

## How to Use:
It was developed in NetBeans, utilizing dynamic libraries for its construction as well as local data input.
