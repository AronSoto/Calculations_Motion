This proyect "Calculations in Motion" repository. Here, you'll find a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying calculations related to Motion in a Uniformly Accelerated Straight Line (MRUV), with a specific focus on Time of Pursuit and Time of Encounter.

## Features:
The application provides an introduction to Motion in a Uniformly Accelerated Straight Line (MRUV), covering its fundamental equations and essential concepts. It then explores the Pursuit Time, which describes the duration required for a pursuing object to catch up to a target object, and the Encounter Time, which determines when two objects moving towards each other meet.

## How to Use:
It was developed in NetBeans, utilizing dynamic libraries for its construction as well as local data input.

## Contributing:
Your contributions are highly valued! Whether it's suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or adding new examples, your input enriches the repository and benefits the community. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on contributing.

### Feedback and Support:
